Assignment 4.c

Write a class called Student that has two data members - a string variable called name 
and a double variable called score.  It should have a constructor that takes two values 
and uses them to initialize the data members.  It should have get methods for both data 
members (getName and getScore), but doesn't need any set methods.

Write a separate function (not part of the Student class) called stdDev that takes two 
parameters - an array of pointers to Students and the size of the array - and returns 
the standard deviation for the student scores (the population standard deviation that 
uses a denominator of N, not the sample standard deviation, which uses a different 
denominator).  

(Note: I could have had you use an array of Students for this instead of an array of 
pointers to Students, but I want you to practice pointer syntax.)

The files must be named Student.hpp, Student.cpp and stdDev.cpp.
