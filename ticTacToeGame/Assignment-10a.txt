Assignment 10.a

Write a class called Board that represents a tic-tac-toe board.  It should have 
a 3x3 array as a data member, which will store the locations of the players' moves.  
It should have a default constructor that initializes the 3x3 array to being empty.  
It should have a method called makeMove that takes the x and y coordinates of the 
move (see the example below) and which player's turn it is as parameters.  If that 
location is unoccupied, makeMove should record the move and return true.  If that 
location is already occupied, makeMove should just return false.  There should be 
a method called gameState that takes no parameters and returns a value indicating 
one of four possibilities: 'x' has won, 'o' has won, the game is a draw, or the 
game is still in progress - use an enum for this (the enum definition should go 
in Board.hpp).  There should also be a method called print, which just prints out 
the current board to the screen.

Write a class called TicTacToe that allows two people to play a game.  This class 
will have a field for a Board object and a field to keep track of which player's 
turn it is.  It should have a constructor that takes a char parameter that specifies 
whether 'x' or 'o' should have the first move.  It should have a method called play 
that starts the game.  The play method should keep looping, asking the correct 
player for their move and sending it to the board (with makeMove) until someone has
won or it's a draw (as indicated by gameState), and then declare what the outcome was.

Write a main method (in TicTacToe.cpp) that asks the user which player should go 
first, creates a new TicTacToe object and starts the game.  For this project (10.a) 
only, you will not comment out your main method.

Input validation: If someone tries to take an occupied square, tell them that square 
is already occupied and ask for a different move
