Assignment 7.a Description

Write a class called Rectangle with double fields for its length and width.  
It should have set methods for both fields.  It should have a constructor that 
takes two double parameters and passes them to the set methods.  It should also 
have a method called area that returns the area of the Rectangle and a method 
called perimeter that returns the perimeter of the Rectangle.

Write a class called Square that inherits from Rectangle.  It should have a 
constructor that takes one double parameter and passes it to the base class 
constructor for both parameters (the body of the constructor will be empty).  
Square will also need to override the setLength() and setWidth() functions of 
its base class such that if either of its dimensions is set to a new value, 
then both of its dimensions will be set to that new value (so that it remains 
a square).  Hint: you can have the overridden versions call the versions in the 
base class.

The files must be called: Rectangle.hpp, Rectangle.cpp, Square.hpp and Square.cpp
