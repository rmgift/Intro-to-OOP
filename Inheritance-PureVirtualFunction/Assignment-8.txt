Assignment-8b Description

Write a class called CustomerProject.  It should have three double fields called hours 
(the number of hours the project took), materials (the cost of materials) and 
transportation (transportation costs), in that order.  It should have get and set methods 
for each field.  It should have a constructor that takes as parameters the values for 
each field and calls the set methods to initialize them.  It should have a pure virtual 
function called billAmount that takes no parameters and returns a double.

Write two classes that inherit from CustomerProject: RegularProject and PreferredProject.  
Both should have a constructor that takes three doubles and passes them to the base class 
constructor.  RegularProject should override billAmount to return the sum of the materials 
costs, the transportation costs, and $80 times the number of hours.  PreferredProject 
(for preferred customers) should override billAmount to return the sum of 85% of the
 materials costs, 90% of the transportation costs, and $80 times the number of hours up to 
 a maximum of 100 hours (any hours beyond 100 are free).

Hint: You can access the member data of the base class either of two ways: 1) make that 
member data protected in the base class, or 2) simply use the get methods, which the 
derived classes have inherited.

There are no input validation or output formatting requirements.

The files must be called: 
CustomerProject.hpp, CustomerProject.cpp, RegularProject.hpp, RegularProject.cpp, 
PreferredProject.hpp, and PreferredProject.cpp.
